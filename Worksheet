There are some tasks here before you start coding!
Please make notes!

Task 1: Keywords
Match the keywords with the definitions: (copy and paste)

-Data Structure
-Array
-element
-Storage
-List
-Map

=A set of data values of the same type, stored in a sequence in a computer program.
= contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key and value pair. Each key and value pair is known as an entry. Contains unique keys.
=The way that data is stored in a database or program.
=An individual component of an array.
= found in the java.util package and inherits the Collection interface.
  Has the facility to maintain the ordered collection. It contains the index-based methods to insert, update, delete and search the elements.
  It can have the duplicate elements also. We can also store the null elements in the list.

---------------------------------
Task 2: Predict:
Look at the code below and have a guess what it would output.
Feel free to check answers by copying and pasting it to a new java file and runing it.

i)
int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
System.out.println(myNum[1]);

PREDICTED OUTPUT: .....
ACTUAL OUTPUT: ....

ii)
int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
myNum[3] = 64;
myNum[3] = 77;
System.out.println(myNum[3]);

PREDICTED OUTPUT: .....
ACTUAL OUTPUT: ....

iii)
int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
myNum[4] = 50;

System.out.println(myNum[4] );

PREDICTED OUTPUT: .....
ACTUAL OUTPUT: ....

iv)
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} }; //2D array
int x = myNumbers[1][2];
System.out.println(x);


PREDICTED OUTPUT: .....
ACTUAL OUTPUT: ....

v) (Try this link to run the code: https://learn.onlinegdb.com/JU4zjIoMc)
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;

		ArrayList<Integer> myNum = new ArrayList<>();
		myNum.add(20);
		myNum.add(10);
		myNum.add(40);
		myNum.add(30);
		Collections.sort(myNum);
		
		System.out.println(myNum.get(3));
----------------------------------------------------------
Task 3:
Look at the demos for arrays and lists. Pay attention to how they are created.
There are methods created as well to showcase some of their build-in functions.
Comment areas where you think it might help.
If you are really comfortable with it, add some extenstions to it. Make a bubble sort, or create another array/list.
Search for specific values etc

------------------------------------------------------------
Task 4:
Program/ debug code on Hash Map Exercise and Comic Book.
hash map is similar to other data structures, but it stores key/value pairs, like a database.
Push your changes when you think it is done, or want to keep a save. 
Try pushing your changes to another branch then merge it when you are happy with it!
If sharing code and working together separately, you can code a method each! 
And see how it works when merged.

If you are ever stuck, ask a friend and look at the examples. While they may be different data structures they handle data very similarly.
Look at w3schools too.

Which data structures are appropriate for what kinds of tasks?
Do they have varying speeds?
