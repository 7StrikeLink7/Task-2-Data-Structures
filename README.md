# Task-2-Data-Structures
Please open this on your own machines or using gitpod (the botton near the top of the page).
Feel free to invite a friend to help and work together, or by pair programming where one of you is the driver (types code) 
and the other is a navigator (communicating ideas and helping what to type).

In this repository, we have a few files for you to look at:

We have a worksheet text file for you to type your notes too, so look at that first.
The first step is to match the keyword to the definition.
Then to predict the outcome of a snippet of code.

There is an array demo and a List (arraylist, linked list) demo. Showing basic functions on how to add more values, and how to create them.
Please read through the code, making predictions. Then run the code to see if you are correct.

Two coding tasks have been given: HashMapExercise, and ComicBook.
Look at HashMapExercise first and have a go at doing the tasks provided on the comments.
Comic book uses a hash map to store 'quality' with a 'price'. It also uses an enumeration which are like constants.

Remember to save your work, and push your changes.
Some feedback can be given but don't be alarmed if you see a lot of red text before you have started, as it is just checking that the tasks have yet to be completed.
